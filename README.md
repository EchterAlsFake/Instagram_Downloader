# Instagram Downloader


We all know the great Osintgram from Datalux.  Sadly this project is dead... <br>
I will try to continue this with a Graphical User Interface.  This is also my personal <br>
Project for learning PySide6.  Ths Source code will of course be available to you!

# What API are you using? 

### I am using the [Instagrapi](https://github.com/adw0rd/instagrapi)


# 2FA? 

### Currently 2FA is not working, but I plan to implement it, so that you can stay safe. 

# Is this secure?

#### Yes, I need your Account to log in to fetch the data, but you can look at the Source Code and compile it by yourself.

# Is this actively maintained?

### It all belongs on how much time I have...

# Supported Systems:

- Windows (Pre Compiled)
- Linux (Pre Compiled)
- Every other OS with a Graphical User Interface and Python 3.x Support
